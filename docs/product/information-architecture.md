# Navigation Principles

## Reading First

The shortest path should always lead users back to reading.

---

## Minimal Friction

Users should be able to start reading within two taps.

---

## Consistent Structure

Navigation patterns should remain predictable throughout the platform.

---

## Progressive Discovery

Advanced features should be introduced gradually as users engage with the platform.

---

# MVP Rule

If a screen does not directly support:

- Reading
- Discovery
- Organization
- Progression

it should not be included in the MVP.
